        <h2 >Welcome National College</h2>
        <p><b>NATIONAL COLLEGE TALIPARAMBA</b>, was established in 1975 with the aim of imparting tuition classes for school and college going students as well as SSLC failed students of nearby schools. At the time of inception the classes were conducted in a rented building. <br>Shri. <b>M V Purushothaman</b> was the founder Principal and he still continues in the post. As a result of the hard work of faculty and excellent management of the promoters this venture became a great success grand.<br>

In 1978, the college started Pre-Degree course for private registered students of Calicut University. Within a few years the college became very popular among the students and parents of neighbouring villages and towns. The student strength increased and the management thought of alternate arrangement to accommodate the growing number of students.

In due course undergraduate course B A English, B A History, B A Economics, B A Political Science, B A Malayalam, B.Sc Math and post graduate classes for the above courses were started. The low fee structure and the variety course offered by the college attracted eligible students, especially financially backward students in large numbers.

          Principal, Shri <b>Purushothaman M V</b>
		  
		  Education is meant to create a gripping edge in all walks of a student's life in all proportions. It is not merely a physical exercise of learning new things , rather a noble venture to culturise one ethically, intellectually, artistically, philosophically and what not. We have such a vision to expand the horizon of opportunities for the learners with a view to create a society of students with great values. This is very much possible through the systematic and impeccable learning process and atmosphere provided in the college. It is needless to say that we have a team of  dedicated staff with profound knowledge to put all the plans into action in an outstanding manner. 
		  
          <br><br>
 In addition to all conventional methods and style of teaching learning processes, we constantly look forward to introducing new strategies and programmes for the overall development of students. Because learning is a never-ending process which has to be incorporated with novel trends and technologies. All our efforts and endeavours in a conscientious fashion have made our college a unique place for learning.          </p>
